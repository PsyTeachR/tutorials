# Multi-Row Headers

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE}

```

A student on our help forum once asked for help making a wide-format dataset long. When I tried to load the data, I realised the first three rows were all header rows. Here's the code I wrote to deal with it.

First, I'll make a small CSV "file" below. In a typical case, you'd read the data in from a file.

```{r data}
demo_csv <- "SUB1, SUB1, SUB1, SUB1, SUB2, SUB2, SUB2, SUB2
COND1, COND1, COND2, COND2, COND1, COND1, COND2, COND2
X, Y, X, Y, X, Y, X, Y
10, 15, 6, 2, 42, 4, 32, 5
4, 43, 7, 34, 56, 43, 2, 33
77, 12, 14, 75, 36, 85, 3, 2"
```

If you try to read in this data, you'll get a message about the duplicate column names and the resulting table will have "fixed" column headers and the next two columns headers as the first two rows.

```{r get-data-bad, error=TRUE, message = FALSE}
data <- read_csv(demo_csv)
```

```{r, echo = F, results='asis'}
kable(data) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Instead, you should read in just the header rows by setting `n_max` equal to the number of header rows and `col_names` to `FALSE`.

```{r get-headers, message = FALSE}
data_head <- read_csv(demo_csv, 
                      n_max = 3, 
                      col_names = FALSE)
```

You will get a table that looks like this:

```{r, echo = F, results='asis'}
kable(data_head) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

You can then make new header names by pasting together the names in the three rows by summarising across all the columns with the `paste()` function and collapsing them using "_". Use `unlist()` and `unname()` to convert the result from a table to a vector.

```{r new-names}
new_names <- data_head %>%
  summarise(across(.fns = paste, collapse = "_")) %>%
  unlist() %>% unname()

new_names
```

Now you can read in the data without the three header rows. Use `skip` to skip the headers and set `col_names` to the new names.

```{r get-data, mess}
data <- read_csv(demo_csv, 
                 skip = 3, 
                 col_names = new_names,
                 show_col_types = FALSE)
```


```{r, echo = F, results='asis'}
kable(data) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

If you have an excel file that merges the duplicate headers across rows, it's a little trickier, but still do-able.

The first steps is the same: read in the first three rows.

```{r, message = FALSE}
data_head <- read_excel("data/3headers_demo.xlsx",
                        n_max = 3, 
                        col_names = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = F, results='asis'}
kable(data_head) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

The code below starts at the second column and fills in any missing data with the value in the previous column.

```{r}
for (i in 2:ncol(data_head)) {
  prev <- data_head[, i-1]
  this <- data_head[, i]
  missing <- is.na(this)
  this[missing, ] <- prev[missing, ]
  data_head[, i] <- this
}
```

Now you can continue generating the pasted name the same as above.

```{r new-names-2}
new_names <- data_head %>%
  summarise(across(.fns = paste, collapse = "_")) %>%
  unlist() %>% unname()

new_names
```

If your data are set up with multiple headers, you'll probably want to change the shape of the data. Here's a quick example how to use `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` to do this with variable names like above.

```{r wide-to-long}
data <- read_excel("data/3headers_demo.xlsx", 
                   skip = 3, 
                   col_names = new_names)

data_long <- data %>%
  # add a row ID column if one doesn't exist already
  mutate(trial_id = row_number()) %>%
  # make a row for each data column
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -trial_id, # everything except trial_id
    names_to = c("sub_id", "condition", "coord"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "val"
  ) %>%
  # make x and y coord columns
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = coord,
    values_from = val
  )
```

```{r, echo = F, results='asis'}
kable(data_long) %>%
  kable_styling()
```
